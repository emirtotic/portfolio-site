# Intro

I am a passionate programmer with an interest in technology that has lasted since childhood. Combining knowledge in programming with experience in music and sports, I am developing as a professional who values teamwork and perseverance. I graduated in Computer Science and currently work as a software engineer at Hyperoptic in Belgrade. I have 4 years of experience as a Java developer and continuously invest in my education through further training in Java programming and hands-on projects. My goal is to find a position that will allow me further growth and the opportunity to apply my skills in a professional environment.

# Some History

- I was born in Užice on February 2, 1992. I completed my elementary and high school education in Arilje while also attending music school in Užice. Alongside my interests in music and sports, I have always shown a strong interest in the world of IT. In September 2014, I enrolled in the Faculty of Computer Science at the International University in Novi Pazar, where I graduated with top marks in Computer Systems Security, focusing on the topic of biometric security. After completing my undergraduate studies, I decided to continue with professional training to prepare myself for my future career. During my studies, I developed a desire to explore the world of programming, so in October 2019, I enrolled in a practical Java programming course at Cubes School in Belgrade, where I gained my first hands-on experience with Java programming and recognized software engineering as my life’s calling. Due to the excellent results I achieved, I quickly found my first job, and thus began my career as a software engineer. I also possess strong communication skills, which are the result of life experience, years of professional work in the music industry, and engagement in sports, where my semi-professional career taught me the value of a healthy team atmosphere and being a team player.
