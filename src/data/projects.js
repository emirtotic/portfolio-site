The project spans a wide range of technologies developed over the years, and my daily responsibilities include backend development using Java and SQL, optimizing system performance, maintaining Kafka-based communication pipelines, and building custom integrations with third-party services. I also contribute to document generation using Jasper, CI/CD processes through Jenkins, and internal tools that support our customer support agents. Collaboration with product and technical teams is key to delivering scalable and reliable features within this large-scale system.',
